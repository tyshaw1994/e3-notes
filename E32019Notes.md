# Ubisoft

## New games
- Watch Dogs Legion (Mar. 6 2020) - Looked more interesting than the other Watch Dogs games, but still had a lot of distracting and cringy dialog.
- Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint (Oct. 4 2019) - Boring trailer with no gameplay, but THEY BROUGHT A DOGGO ON STAGE.
- Tom Clancy's Elite Squad (no release date given) - Mobile game. 
- Just Dance 2020 (Nov. 2019) 
- Rainbow Six Quarantine (early 2020) - "3 player tactical co-op"
- Roller Champions (pre-alpha available today, no release date given) - Looks like Ubi's answer to Rocket League in a way, basketball on roller skates or something like that.
- Gods & Monsters (Feb. 25 2020) - New game by the guys that did AssCreed Odyssey, Fortnite-like artstyle. No gameplay so no idea what kind of game it is, but probably action-oriented.

## Updates
- For Honor Shadows of the Hitokiri (available now)
- The Division 2 Episode 3 (early 2020) - DLC

### Grade: D+

#### The Good

- Nothing exciting or surprising

- Too much focus on games that were already announced
